# Weather-Web-App

Built a weather web app which provides accurate weather informations of different locations. With the help of an API, it can fetch the data of a given location and displays it to the user. 

Had a lot of fun using Javascript, Node.js and Express.js as server side to build this! You may look at the code now though it can be improved as I'm progressing further. 

Link to the live application available soon.
